# Strategy Pattern Showcase - Discount Codes

This is a simple project to showcase the benefits of using the Strategy Pattern.

## Instructions

Make the necessary changes to the `ShoppingCart` class so that the following discount codes can be applied with the `ApplyDiscount` method:

- **BOGOFREE**:  Buy One Get One Free on any item
- **BRAND2DISCOUNT**:  10% off all items from Brand2
- **10PERCENTOFF**:  10% off the entire cart
- **BRAND1MANIA**:  50% off every item from Brand1
- **5USDOFF**:  $5 off the entire cart

## Running the code

This project provides a simple console application in the `DiscountCodes.ConsoleRunner` project to demonstrate the functionality of the `ShoppingCart` class and the discount strategies. 

Additionally, unit tests are included in the `DiscountCodes.Tests` project to verify the correctness of the discount strategies.
